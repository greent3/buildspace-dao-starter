**None of the code was written by me!** 

I merely implemented the logic step-by-step. It was more of a walkthough on DAO structure and the steps for building one.
**I learned about:**
- Deploying ERC721(NFT) & ERC1155s(Fungible Tokens)
- Deploying ERC20
- Airdropping tokens
- Creating a treasury
- Creating vote proposals
- Granting & Revoking roles
- Different modules required for a DAO (a contract for voting, a contract for tokens, a contract for NFT drop, etc.)
